This week I want to achieve creating different templates of react projects:
- login using set username and password variables
- register form that will save data to a database application (firebase)
- play around with design aspects to see how to make interface aesthetically pleasing

## 28/09/2022
I have achieved setting up a login system if the username and password was set. I also know how to save information to a firebase real time database.

I will be working on how to retrieve information to database to authenticate someone.
30/09/2022

I have now completed all my tutorials for using firebase and now can add, update, delete, and retrieve data from my database. I will be looking into how integrate specific React-Bootstrap components for design purposes.

I am currently drawing up some wireframes for my mental health journal - this means I will be researching HCI theories on website layout to ensure I can work on my idea of inclusive design.

## 02/10/2022
I recently found out there is a specific way of authentication in firebase so I have now decided to use that method when I will eventually set up my first interface. The reason I'm using firebase's authentication and Firestore database instead of making my own from will be because it is easier to set up as I have done a tutorial already and it also doesn't require too much set up, which will allow me to focus mon the design aspect of my interfaces rather than a simple functionality such as creating an account and logging into the interface.

I still have yet decided how I'm designing my interfaces, so I will be working on wireframes (planed layouts of my pages), creating my deliverables this week and compiling a folder of all the images I would like to use, including colour schemes to fit with my inclusive design.

I will also be reading on how to implement a software engineering technique into my project so I can discuss it in my report, as I have no need to use design patterns instead I will be using TDD. This will most likely be either unit testing, if possible; I have heard of a technique to show like a demo but as a test rather than a demo to present.

Therefore by 5th/6th of October, I will be ready to start creating the base layout of my mental health journal.

## 04/10/2022
I did some image sampling for my interfaces to make it easier to add interactive components.

I also tried some testing with a tool called cypress. Cypress is a Javascript testing tool that tests end-to-end. I will be using this for interaction testing?

## 06/10/2022
I have now done the authentication however I would still like to use a container component within the page rather than building within the page. 

I will be building the online journal page next and seeing how to access journal pages.

## 11/10/2022
I have been sick, so the past couple of days, so I'm working on the journal entry page and finding a way to save it to a database with the user's email to differentiate from different user's entries. The email will be a unique identifier since no two accounts can have the same email address.

## 13/10/2022
I have been really struggling on how to save the title, entry, current date and email to a real-time database. So I might take a pause on that functionality and focus more on design and the other interactions my user will use.

In the coming week, I will also be looking to test the functionality that I have already completed.

## 15/10/2022
Since I am struggling to save journal entries, I'm still going to build the table that can show previous entries even it is empty to show my original design for the history page. I'm going to try and stop worrying about if it works or doesn't and just try and see if I can create my main elements and get it on to the page. As even though functionality is important, I want to make sure that a user can be able still interact with the rest of the available features that I wanted to implement such as changing the colour settings to make the design of the website feel more inclusive.

## 18/10/2022
I have figured how to save journal entries and how to save multiple entries to one user. Now I will be working on how to present the multiple entries in a table format to show the history of the journal entries. I will also be focusing on adding images to brighten up my journal and not make it so bland in design and colour.

My next focus will be transferring all these achievements on to the interim report as I haven't kept up on it as much I would have liked. So I would like to at least finish up technical achievements and interface breakdown for my 1st interface.

## 21/10/2022
I worked on the history table today, it doesn't work yet, still trying to debug what contents are being read and if the structure I have created is actually being updated. I also decided on creating an alternative theme, however I still don't understand how to exchange the two themes within the interface. I researched it and it may not be possible with the browser I'm currently using to test the website so may need to revaluate where I deploy and edit my website.

## 24/10/2022
I need to accomplish these tasks:
- finish re-designed wireframes for the mental health online journal
- Present journal entries on to history page -> currently it works but isn't going through the individual journal entries.
- Inter-changing aesthetic themes to work -> currently only works by overwriting the first style sheet that is imported.
- Create simple wireframes for 2nd interface, in preparation to start the 2nd interface.
- Simple documentation for the first interface.

## 27/10/2022
I have now completely finished all the base functionality of my 1st interface. I would like to finish my last bit of css, to change theme before focusing on my 2nd interface prep (Wireframes, compare and contrast of other learning platforms, node modules required.)
Hopefully starting on 31st I will have created at least base React app for my 2nd interface.

## 31/10/2022
I was unable to fix the toggle theme, but I have put it on my backlog until I have more time to revisit the first interface and work on the feedback that was also given to me by my supervisor; which was to add more pictorial elements to the webpage.

I have officially started my 2nd interface, this week I will be working on the navigation bar and getting together the images that I will be using within my tool, this includes the everyday objects, and shapes. By the end of the week the base design should be complete. I will also research on what type of quiz functionality I would like to do hopefully one that should engage most children, and how to make the images instantly become grayscale through a method or css.

## 03/11/2022
I am currently making base functionality for my 2nd interface and making sure to include bright colours and images that will make sure to help with users who are affected by colour blindness as bright colours can be contrast and make it easier to identify certain colours.
The rest of the week will be building other base pages, I still need to collect everyday object pictures that the shapes can go over or highlight to be more recognisable.

Doing research on and writing up my findings in the interim report:
- When is something recognisable and familiar to children
- Quiz functionality will be most effective towards learning and usability
- General cognitive memory skills for 18 months - 3 yrs. old (might increase my target demographic up till 6/7 yrs.)

## 07/11/2022
I have started to create the containers for each of the shape pages, next I will work on the grayscale method to help colour blind people. I will finish these containers by tomorrow properly.

## 12/11/2022
I am focusing on the interim report but I will be trying again to try and make my toggle themes (mental-health-online-journal) as I really would like to showcase it in my interim "code breakdown" section.

I might try the same way on the grayscale img for the shape learning tool.

## 18/11/2022
I am still working on the interim report, doing feedback from supervisor and doing code clean up alongside.
Hoping to get the interim done by the weekend so the presentation slides can be filled with content.

## 24/11/2022
I will be changing my css to fit more of a dark mode theme, however will need to makes sure it isn't going to create depressing reaction for users as it is a mental health journal.

Still working on my report, and will film video this weekend.

## 29/11/2022
Finishing interim report, and creating slides and last minute code checks - documentation.
